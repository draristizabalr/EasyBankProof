### What I learned

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

It's was a really interesting way to do this page because I learn about how to use images better and try to be clear in my code structure. I use a lot of components and divede code but this is a really usefull to grow up this project in a Future.

Also this is an exciting process because to build the desktop page it was very quickly but migrated to movil it was a challenge and that it is that I am looking for.

Learning more about Tailwind CSS and use components to create a better CSS experience.
