## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Built tool
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles

### What I learned

It's was a really interesting way to do this page because I learn about how to use images better and try to be clear in my code structure. I use a lot of components and divede code but this is a really usefull to grow up this project in a Future.

Also this is an exciting process because to build the desktop page it was very quickly but migrated to movil it was a challenge and that it is that I am looking for.

Learning more about Tailwind CSS and use components to create a better CSS experience.
